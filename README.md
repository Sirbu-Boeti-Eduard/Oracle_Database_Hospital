# Oracle_Database_Hospital
  This project was made during my senior year in High School for my Computer Operator Certification, together with https://github.com/Mihnea1603. 

  In this repository you can find a .sql file and a .pptx file. In the .sql file there is the code for creating the tables and for populating them with entries.
In the .pptx file there is a diagram of the relational database.
